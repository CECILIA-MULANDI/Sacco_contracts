My deployment decisions:
Decide to use thirdweb for deploying..so no scripts were written.
Directly used one of thirdweb's hardhat templates and after the contract was ready, we did 
npx thirdweb deploy -k secret key
Overview

There are two main contracts:

BlockCoopTokens: A token management system for a cooperative
MyLoanManager: A lending system that leverages the tokens deposited in the cooperative

Key Flow
1. Token Deposit System 

Users can deposit whitelisted ERC20 tokens into the BlockCoopTokens contract
These tokens serve as a pool of liquidity for the cooperative
Tokens are whitelisted by fund managers or the owner
Each token has an associated price feed 

2. Loan Request Process

A user who has deposited tokens can request a loan through MyLoanManager
They specify:

Which token they want to borrow
How much they want to borrow
Which of their deposited tokens to use as collateral
The loan duration



3. Loan Approval Process

A fund manager reviews the loan request
The system calculates the collateral value and loan value in USD
Verifies the loan-to-value ratio is below the maximum threshold (70%)
Checks that the borrower has sufficient collateral in the BlockCoopTokens contract
Calculates an interest rate based on risk factors

4. Loan Issuance

When approved, collateral tokens are transferred from BlockCoopTokens to MyLoanManager
